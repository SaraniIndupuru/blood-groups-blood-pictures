                History of Blood</h1><br>

            <p style="font-family: 'Roboto',sans-serif; font-size: larger;text-align: justify; text-indent: 35px; line-height: 42px;">Blood is a body fluid in the circulatory system of humans and other vertebrates
            that delivers necessary substances such as nutrients and oxygen to the cells, and transports metabolic waste products away from
            those same cells.Blood is composed of blood cells suspended in blood plasma. Plasma, which constitutes 55% of blood fluid, is
            mostly water (92% by volume),and contains proteins, glucose, mineral ions, and hormones. The blood cells
            are mainly red blood cells (erythrocytes), white blood cells (leukocytes), and (in mammals) platelets
            (thrombocytes). The most abundant cells are red blood cells.These contain hemoglobin, which
            facilitates oxygen transport by reversibly binding to it, increasing its solubility. Jawed vertebrates
            have an adaptive immune system, based largely on white blood cells. White blood cells help to resist
            infections and parasites. Platelets are important in the clotting of blood.
            Blood is circulated around the body through blood vessels by the pumping action of the heart. In animals
            with lungs, arterial blood carries oxygen from inhaled air to the tissues of the body, and venous blood
            carries carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism produced by cells, from the tissues to the lungs to be
            exhaled. Blood is bright red when its hemoglobin is oxygenated and dark red when it is deoxygenated.
            Medical terms related to blood often begin with hemo-, hemato-, haemo- or haemato- from the Greek word αἷμα
            (haima) for "blood". In terms of anatomy and histology, blood is considered a specialized form of connective
            tissue, given its origin in the bones and the presence of potential molecular fibers in the form of
            fibrinogen.
            Blood pH is regulated to stay within the narrow range of 7.35 to 7.45, making it slightly basic (compensation).[17][18] Extra-cellular fluid in blood that has a pH below 7.35 is too acidic, whereas blood pH above 7.45 is too basic.[16] A pH below 6.9 or above 7.8 is usually lethal.[16] Blood pH, partial pressure of oxygen (pO2), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2), and bicarbonate (HCO3−) are carefully regulated by a number of homeostatic mechanisms, which exert their influence principally through the respiratory system and the urinary system to control the acid–base balance and respiration, which is called compensation.[16] An arterial blood gas test measures these. Plasma also circulates hormones transmitting their messages to various tissues. 
            The list of normal reference ranges for various blood electrolytes is extensive.
            Blood is circulated around the body through blood vessels by the pumping action of the heart. In humans, blood is pumped from the strong left ventricle of the heart through arteries to peripheral tissues and returns to the right atrium of the heart through veins. It then enters the right ventricle and is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs and returns to the left atrium through the pulmonary veins. Blood then enters the left ventricle to be circulated again. Arterial blood carries oxygen from inhaled air to all of the cells of the body, and venous blood carries carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism by cells, to the lungs to be exhaled. However, one exception includes pulmonary arteries, 
            which contain the most deoxygenated blood in the body, while the pulmonary veins contain oxygenated blood.
            Additional return flow may be generated by the movement of skeletal muscles, which can compress veins and push blood through the valves in veins toward the right atrium.

The blood circulation was famously described by William Harvey in 1628.</p>
